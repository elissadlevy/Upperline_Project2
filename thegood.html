          <p>This is the website of fine artist Andrea Geller, who happens to be my aunt.  The site was designed by Emma Jablonski, who happens to be my cousin.  Although the family ties incentivize me to love the design, I do independently think it's great.  Whitespace is well utilized.  The navigation bar at the top helps the user find what he or she is looking for.  If you look closely, the images on the page are actually meant to look like they're in a gallery; there's a wooden floor at the bottom of the page.  Fonts are used consistently, and the color scheme is subtle and does not detract from the user's experience.</p>

          <span class="card-title">The Materialize Website</span>
          <p>I am glad to have been introduced to Materialize; it's an easy way to create the streamlined page appearance to which a good web developer should aspire.  Unsurprisingly, the Materialize page is a great example of good web design.  The fonts are consistent.  Whitespace is utilized well.  Images serve a clear purpose.  Content is organized.  Frankly, if Materialize were unable to lay out content well on their main page, then they would probably lose users - and fast!  One thing I noticed, though, is that clicking on an item from the left-hand nav bar results in a resetting of the bar to being scrolled to the top.  So that's the one thing I'd fix: have the nav bar stay scrolled where it is when the user selects one of the items.</p>

          <span class="card-title">Wikipedia</span>
          <p>I really like the design of Wikipedia.  Their branding is so clearly done throughout, that I could look at a screenshot of any page and immediately know that it's from Wikipedia.  Images are reliably located on the right.  The nav bar on the left is consistent.  Fonts are consistent.  Hierarchy of content is clearly delineated with links from a table of contents for articles that are sufficiently long.  The lines are clean and the color is consistent, and it's just a nice page to look at overall.</p>
