          <p>The homepage is not horrible, although it definitely looks like it was made in the 1990's (which it was).  But if you click into the specific timelines, that's where the formatting gets really problematic.  There's not enough whitespace on the left and right sides.  The table has a weird border, and no space between the font and the edge of the table.  There isn't a clean color scheme that helps draw the eye to certain parts.  To make the timelines easier to read, I would create a visual that is actually a timeline, where people can click on each element for a pop-up that provides more info.</p>

          <span class="card-title">My 2004 Summer Math Class</span>
          <p>This page is basically the blog for a summer course I took in 2004.  It chronicles the problem sets and proposed solutions from my class.  There needs to be more whitespace, more buffer on the left and right.  Italics, font color, and highlighting appear to be used randomly instead of purposefully.  The page also has no title.  That said, there's something beautiful about its simplicity and inconsistency, the way the page unabashedly celebrates the starkness of its design.  It parallels the way that nerds wear shorts and flip flops in winter to brazenly publicize their focus on substance, not form.</p>

          <span class="card-title">Edward Tufte</span>
          <p>Although Tufte is hailed as a guru of representing information visually, his site doesn't embody the best design principles.  I vaguely remember it being worse a few years ago, but it's still bad.  The content on the page is too dense, and it's not clear where the eye should be drawn.  There is a strange assortment of fonts, some serif and some sans serif.  The navigation bar at the top is uninformative.  Images are inserted seemingly randomly.  I would improve this page by giving it clearer headers and sections, with a unified font.  Much of the content currently on the landing page should be moved to other pages, which users can click through.</p>
